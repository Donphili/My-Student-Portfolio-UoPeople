Welcome to my repository for assignments completed during my ongoing studies at the University of the People. Here, you'll find a collection of my academic work organized into folders, making it convenient to browse through and review.

## Structure

- Each assignment is neatly organized within its own dedicated folder.
- Inside each assignment folder, you'll discover:
  - The assignment instructions (e.g., assignment.pdf).
  - Any supplementary materials provided.
  - My completed submissions (if applicable).

## Usage

Feel free to explore the assignments to gain insights into the coursework and topics covered throughout my ongoing education journey. While I encourage learning and sharing knowledge, please refrain from copying or plagiarizing my work. Instead, use it as a reference to enhance your understanding and inspire your own academic endeavors.

## Contributions

As these assignments are personal academic endeavors, I'm not seeking contributions to this repository at the moment. However, if you spot any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue.
